This package uses a Bayesian formulation and Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling methods to 
derive posterior distributions of subsurface and measured data properties. 
The current implementation is applied to time and frequency domain electro-magnetic data. 
Application outside of these data types is well within scope.

Currently there are two types of data that we have implemented; frequency domain electromagnetic data, 
and time domain electromagnetic data. 
The package comes with a frequency domain forward modeller, but it does not come with a time domain forward modeller.  
See the section :ref:`Installing_time_domain_forward_modeller` for more information.


Using GeoBIPy on Yeti
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::
There is no need to install GeoBIPy on Yeti.  Simply type "module load python/geobipy" for the serial version of the code, mainly used for plotting results, or "module load python/pGeobipy" for a parallel enabled version.
